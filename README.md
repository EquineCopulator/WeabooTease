# How to Play

- Open index.html with a web browser.

However, this github repository does not contain binary files, that is, images and sound effects. They need to be fetched elsewhere, or custom substitutes need to be supplied.

# Customizing Images

- Put images in `/img` folder.
- Modify image lists in `sc/res_img.js` accordingly.
- To make sense, `R.IMG.V` images should depict penetrations and `R.IMG.H` images should not.
